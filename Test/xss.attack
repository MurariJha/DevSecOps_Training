Feature : Check for cross site scripting (xss) vulunerability using arachni against gruyere 

Given "arachni" is installed

When I launch an "arachni" attack with :

"""
arachni  -- checks =XSS --scope-page-limit=1 <http://IPhostname:port/login> 

"""

Then the output should contain "0 issue were detected"
